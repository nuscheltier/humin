# Humin - Hugin and Munin
  
It's just a little software to help me keep notes for my RPG Plays and Stories I write.

## Database  
  
The Database of Humin is graphlike. It consists of Nodes, Edges, and Properties. It is initialized via the DB object and it saves/loads via `json`-file. So it's easy to backup, if need be.
